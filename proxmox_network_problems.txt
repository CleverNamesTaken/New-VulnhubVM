To fix these do the following:
1. Interrupt the boot process by pressing `e` when presented with the grub menu
2. Change the line that begins with linux as follows
        2a: ro > rw
        2b: append "init=/bin/bash"
3. CTRL+X to resume the booting and get a shell.
4. Replace the network interface name in either /etc/network/interfaces or /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml with the network interface on your vm.  For example:

MY_INTERFACE=$(ip -o link show | tail -n1 | cut -d ':' -f2)
sed -i "s/enps03/$MY_INTERFACE/" /etc/network/interfaces

5. Reboot the machine ( see https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/sysrq.html )
echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
echo o > /proc/sysrq-trigger #Note that this is the letter o, not 0
